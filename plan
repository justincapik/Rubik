for now:
		- use longs for the corners XXXXXXXX
		- finish the converter (also to check if the rotations are right) XXXXXX
		- recheck the rotations XXXXX
		- finish rotations XXXXXXX
		- do the heuristic database
			- hash table
			- depth search
		- manhattan for sides?
		- ida*

at some point:
		- use red and black tree for closed list
		- change closed list cube comparison to check for exact doubles
