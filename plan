for now:
		- use longs for the corners XXXXXXXX
		- finish the converter (also to check if the rotations are right) XXXXXX
		- recheck the rotations XXXXX
		- finish rotations XXXXXXX
		- do the heuristic database XXX DONESN"T WORK FCIUWNEJVKING ROTATIONS ARE WRONG STILL
			- hash table
			- depth search
		- manhattan for sides? XXXXX DONE BUT MF ROTATIONS
		//- fix rotations once and for all
		- ida*
		- add random stuff to heuristic I guess? aligned is worth more/less

at some point:
		- use red and black tree for closed list
		- change closed list cube comparison to check for exact doubles
